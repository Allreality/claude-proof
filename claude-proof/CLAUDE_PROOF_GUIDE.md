## What is Claude Proof?

**Claude Proof** is a protection system that prevents AI assistants (like Claude) from modifying critical project files. When a project is "Claude Proofed":

- ✅ Original files remain untouched in their location
- ✅ A timestamped archive copy is created
- ✅ The project is logged in the protection registry
- ✅ AI cannot make changes without explicit user action

## Why Use It?

### Problems It Solves
1. **Accidental Overwrites**: Prevents AI from accidentally modifying working code
2. **Version Control**: Creates timestamped backups automatically
3. **Peace of Mind**: Work on projects knowing originals are safe
4. **Audit Trail**: Every protection is logged with timestamp and description

### When to Claude Proof
- ✅ Projects that are working and deployed
- ✅ Code that took significant time to develop
- ✅ Critical business projects
- ✅ Projects with complex configurations
- ❌ Experimental/throwaway code
- ❌ Projects in active development with AI

## How It Works

### Protection Process
# Create comprehensive Claude Proof documentation
cd /mnt/c/projects/project-hub/claude-proof

## How It Works

### Protection Process
User runs: ./protect.sh protect "/path/to/project" "Description"
Script creates: /archive/claude-proof/project_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
Script logs: project|description|timestamp|archive_name
Confirmation: ✅ CLAUDE PROOF PROTECTION APPLIED

## Usage Guide

### Protect a Project
```bash
cd /mnt/c/projects
./project-hub/claude-proof/protect.sh protect "/full/path/to/project" "Project description"

./project-hub/claude-proof/protect.sh protect \
  "/mnt/c/projects/active-projects/my-app" \
  "My App - Production e-commerce site - 100 hours invested"

./project-hub/claude-proof/protect.sh list

Recovery Process
Scenario 1: Need Original File
# Copy from archive to working directory
cp -R /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/project_TIMESTAMP /tmp/working-copy

# Review the files
cd /tmp/working-copy

# If needed, copy specific files back
cp /tmp/working-copy/important-file.js /original/location/
Scenario 2: Complete Project Restore
# Backup current state first
mv /original/project /original/project.backup

# Restore from archive
cp -R /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/project_TIMESTAMP /original/project

# Test thoroughly before deleting backup
Scenario 3: Compare Versions
# Use diff to compare
diff -r /original/project /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/project_TIMESTAMP

# Or use a visual diff tool
code --diff /original/file.js /archive/project_TIMESTAMP/file.js
Best Practices
✅ DO

Protect working projects - If it works, protect it
Add descriptive notes - Include hours invested, tech stack
Verify protection - Always check with verify command
Review archives periodically - Ensure archives are intact
Document before protecting - Create README if missing

❌ DON'T

Don't protect node_modules alone - Protect entire project
Don't modify archives - They should be read-only references
Don't delete archives - They're your safety net
Don't protect work-in-progress - Wait until stable
Don't skip descriptions - Future you needs context

When to Re-Protect

✅ After major updates to a protected project
✅ Before major refactoring
✅ After adding significant features
✅ Monthly for active projects
❌ Not for every minor change

Naming Conventions
# Good descriptions:
"Project Name - Brief purpose - Hours invested - Status"
"MyApp - E-commerce site - 120 hours - Production"
"Dashboard - Analytics tool - 40 hours - Beta testing"

# Bad descriptions:
"test"
"my project"
"backup"
Troubleshooting
Issue: Protection Fails
# Check permissions
ls -la /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check path exists
ls -la "/path/to/project"

Issue: Can't Find Archive
# List all archives
ls -la /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/

# Search for specific project
find /mnt/c/projects/archive -name "*project-name*"

Issue: Archive Corrupted
# Check archive integrity
ls -R /mnt/c/projects/archive/claude-proof/project_TIMESTAMP/

# If corrupted, protect again
./protect.sh protect "/original/project" "Re-protection due to corruption"

Advanced Usage
Batch Protection

# Protect multiple projects
for project in /mnt/c/projects/active-projects/*/; do
    ./protect.sh protect "$project" "Batch protection $(date)"
done

Automated Protection (Cron)
# Add to crontab for weekly auto-protection
0 0 * * 0 /mnt/c/projects/project-hub/claude-proof/protect.sh protect "/critical/project" "Weekly auto-backup"

Custom Archive Location
# Edit protect.sh to change ARCHIVE_DIR variable
ARCHIVE_DIR="/custom/archive/location"

FAQ
Q: Does Claude Proof prevent all changes?
A: No, it only prevents AI-assisted changes. You can still manually edit files.
Q: What happens to the original files?
A: Nothing. Originals stay in place. Archives are copies.
Q: Can I unprotect a project?
A: Yes, manually remove from protected_items.txt and delete archive if desired.
Q: How much space do archives use?
A: Same as original project. Plan accordingly for large projects with node_modules.
Q: Can I protect the same project twice?
A: Yes, it creates a new timestamped archive each time.
Q: What if I need to work on a protected project with AI?
A: Copy from archive to a working directory, then work on that copy.
